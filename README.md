# RunJS Cracker
A tool to crack the [RunJS application](https://runjs.app/).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool provides access to all RunJS features with any activation key, for example: ```Merry Christmas RunJS```.

The version of **RunJS** currently supported by this tool is **2.9.0**.

However, it is possible to crack all versions of **RunJS** if you know the mappings to be modified. All you need to do is update the JSON file containing the mappings.

The tool works on macOS, Windows and Linux (**Ubuntu**, **Manjaro**), is not guaranteed to work on all Linux platforms.
