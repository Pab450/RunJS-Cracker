# RunJS Cracker
A tool to crack the [RunJS application](https://runjs.app/).

The version of **RunJS** currently supported by this tool is **2.9.0**.

However, it is possible to crack all versions of **RunJS** if you know the mappings to be modified. All you need to do is update the JSON file containing the mappings.

For the moment, **the tool only works on macOS and Windows**. An update will be released shortly to support **Linux**. But if you're a tinkerer, you can easily make it work on any OS.
## Prerequisite
Before you start, make sure you have the following items installed and ready:

**Node.js and npm**: If you haven't already installed them, download and install Node.js and npm from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure that Node.js and npm are accessible from your terminal.

**RunJS**: Download the RunJS application from the [official website](https://runjs.app/). **Install it, run it once and close it**.
## How to use
Now, let's walk through the steps to run the script:

1 - **If you have Git, clone the repository**: Open your terminal and execute the following command to clone the repository containing the crack:
```
git clone https://github.com/pab450/RunJS-Cracker
```
**If you don't have Git, download the repository manually**.

2 - **Open an terminal and navigate to the repository directory**: Use the cd command to enter the project directory you just cloned.

3 - **Install dependencies**: Once you're inside the project directory, run the following command to install project dependencies using npm:
```
npm install
```
4 - **Run the crack**: After the installation is complete, execute the following command to run the crack script:
```
npm run crack
```
### **That's it! Now enter any activation key to access all RunJS features without restrictions**.
